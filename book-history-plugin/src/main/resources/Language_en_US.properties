	Distribution of books in Finland before 1850 \
</h1> \
<h2>Background for users</h2> \
<p> \
	In <i>Distribution of books in Finland before 1850</i> you can find information about books in Finland printed before 1850. \
	The data has mainly been collected in the 1980's and the beginning of the 1990's. \
	The most accurate possible bibliographic information about old books have been collected from 448 municipalities. \
	Information about and hand written signatures and other notes has been registered in the database. \
	The data has been enriched with information from inventory registers of parishes in 1992. \
	These registers usually contain only a short title, the name of the author and the year of print. \
	To improve research use capabilities some dynamic maps and diagrams have been added. \
	It is possible to study for instance the current situation of the mapping or the type of collection (museum, library, parish etc.) or the publication year of the books. \
</p> \
<p> \
	In addition to the municipal mapping also some books from private collections have been added. \
	The user has the possibility to add information about his or her own books or books in other private collections. \
	This information will be checked by the administrators before it is added to the database and published.\

<h2>Background</h2> \
<p> \
	The project <i>Distribution of books in Finland before 1850</i> started in 1983 as a joint venture by the Library of the University of Helsinki, the Department of Church History at the same University and a research project funded by the Academy of Finland called <i>Mapping literature printed before 1850</i>. \
	The aim of the project was to map books printed before 1850 that have been preserved in Finland. \
	Also small prints, flyers, decrees, dissertations, newspapers and journals were included. In the beginning the work was lead by Phil. lic., later Dr Theol. and adjunct professor Jussi Nuorteva.\
</p> \
<p> \
	The mapping had two goals. Firstly, information was collected to identify titles that were missing from the University and other research libraries. \
	Secondly, the mapping was done to support research in books history and the history of ideas, as this kind of data, including information about book ownership, also tells something about how books and ideas have spread over time and space. \
</p> \
<p> \
	The mapping was done municipality by municipality mainly by students in history, literature and church history. \
	They received a brief training before starting their field work. The public collections of every municipality were recorded (museums, parish archives, libraries etc) and information about the mapping was published in newspapers to reach owners of private book collections. \
	Every item was described in detail on a paper form. Large public collections and private collections were only registered as such, so that they could be mapped in detail later. \
	In 1992 the data was enriched with information from the parishes, who sent in data about old books from their inventory registers. \
<p> \
	In 1992 the data from the forms was inserted into a dBaseIV database by trainees and people employed with resources from employment support funding. \
	By 1992 the information from the municipalities and the parishes had been converted to machine readable data. \
	The paper forms are kept at the Departement of Church History at the University of Helsinki. \
</p> \
<p> \
	The publication of the data started in 2014 as part of Tuija Laine's program for developing the prerequisites for research in this field. She is acting professor in book history at the University of Helsinki. In 2015 M. Theol. Timo Salmela built a new database application with financing from the Church Council. Timo Salmela and Cand. Theol. Anna Ruokamo enriched and curated the data with help of funding from the <i>Christian Education in Marginal Groups int the 18th Century</i> project. During the summer 2015 the data and service were accepted to the AVAA service at CSC, where the work can continue. AVAA is funded by the Ministry of Education and Culture as part of the <i>Open Science and Research Initiative</i>. \

<h2> \
	Front page \
</h2> \
<p> \
	The front page displays an overview of the mapping status. The map displays the books according to municipalities as in 2014. \
	The colors on the map reflect the mapping status of each municipality by category (none, parishes, wider mapping). By clicking \
	on a municipality, a popup window opens. In the popup there is information on the associated municipalities and mapping targets. \
</p> \
<p> \
	Below the timeline there is a list of letters. By clicking on the letter a popup window opens, showing a list of authors whose \
	name begins with the particular letter. By clicking on the name, a search is done for books with the author name. A similar list \
	for municipalities works according to the same principles. \
</p> \
<p> \
	The bottom part of the front page holds statistics of books according to language, publication type and mapping target. By clicking \
	on the links you may study information about the books in detail. \
</p> \
<h2> \
	Search book \
</h2> \
<p> \
	The Search tab enables you to run searches for books in the database. The results are displayed in a table, on a map, and on a \
	timeline. Clicking on a book opens more detailed information in a popup window. \
<p> \
	A map displays the results by municipality. By clicking on the municipality you can access detailed statistics. The timeline displays \
	the number of books by year of print. You can print the search criteria and results or save them to a file. Moreover, you can save the \
	results as a csv file. \
</p> \
<h3> \
	Queries \
</h3> \
<p> \
	The word search has several different alternatives, which can be chosen from the dropdown menu next to the search box: \
</p> \
<p> \
	<b>Word search</b> is by default executed as <b>*word*</b> search in the following fields: <b>Author, Title, Printing office, Place of printing, \
	Signature, Dedication, Additional information</b> and <b>Handwritten notes</b>. More alternatives will become visible by clicking <b>More.</b> \
</p> \
<p> \
	The <b>*word*</b> query is executed truncating the string in both ends. If extra wildcard symbols (*) are added in the search, they will \
	be disregarded. The same rules apply if you choose <b>*word</b> or <b>word*</b>, except that the term will be truncated only in the beginning or \
	in the end according to the choice made. If you choose the value <b>word</b> in the dropdown menu, the query will be executed as an case \
	insensitive exact match with no truncation. If wildcard symbols (*) are used in this mode, they will not be disregarded, but included \
	in the query. \
</p> \
<p> \
	Choosing <b>Any of these OR</b> gives you the possibility to make a Boolean search with this specific operator. You can include several space \
	separated terms in the search box. The query will be executed by adding wildcards in both ends of each term and with an OR operator \
	between each term. This means that the search is expanded and all books where any of the given terms appears will be returned in the \
	results. \
</p> \
<p> \
	Choosing <b>All of these AND</b> gives you the opportunity to narrow the Boolean search with this operator. You can include several space \
	separated terms in the search box. The query will be executed by adding wildcards in both ends of each term and with an AND operator \
	between each term. This means that the result will include information about all books that contain all the given terms. \
</p> \
<p> \
	The query will by default be executed in all fields, but you can limit the query to a specific field by choosing Author, Title, Place \
	of printing, Printing office, Dedication, Signature, Handwritten notes or Additional information. \
</p> \
<p> \
	The <b>AND, OR, NOT</b> operations can also be executed between several search criteria by adding a new <b>Word search</b> box by clicking \
	<b>More</b> and then using the radio buttons between them. This way nested queries can be executed. \
</p> \
<p> \
	When the <b>NOT</b> operator is used the terms before the operator will be required, but the terms after this operator will lead to exclusion \
	of the book in question from the result. \
</p> \
<p> \
	The <b>AND</b> operator will execute the query in the same fields as the <b>Word search</b> and Municipality, Province, Publication year, Mapping \
	target, Language, Translated from Publication type and Private library. \
</p> \
<p> \
	<b>Note!</b> If you choose Municipality and Province in the same query, the search will be restricted to municipality. \
</p> \
<p> \
	<b>Publication year</b> refers to the year of printing. If you leave the end year out, you will get all books printed the year given in the left \
	box and after that. If you only type a year in the right box, the query will return information about all books printed this year and before. \
	Not all books have an exact year registered. If you are searching for books printed in the 1880s, please enter 188 in the search box. \
</p> \
<p> \
	The <b>Clear</b> button empties all fields and choices. \
</p> \
	<b>Municipality.</b> Due to administrative changes in Finland some municipalities are mentioned two times, i e Kuopio and Kuopio (vanha). The latter \
	refers to Kuopio as it was in the 1980's and 1990's, when the first mappings were done. On the other hand, only (Kuopio) \
	refers to the current municipality (2015) and thus includes the whole area of previous independent municipalities that today have become part \
	of Kuopio. In practice this means Maaninka and Nilsiä. The former municipality of Längelmäki has been divided between the municipalities of \
	Orivesi and Jämsä. The mappings of Längelmäki are all included in Jämsä. \
